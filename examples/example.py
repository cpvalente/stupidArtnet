# By default, the server uses port 6454, no need to specify it.
# If you need to change the Art-Net port, ensure the port is within the valid range for UDP ports (1024-65535).
# Be sure that no other application is using the selected port on your network.
# To specify a different port, for example port 6455, you can do it like this:
# a = StupidArtnetServer(target_ip, universe, packet_size, 30, True, True, port=6455 )  # Change 6455 to any valid port number between 1024 and 65535.
